BIM stands for *Building Information Modelling* [^1]. It is a similar term to CAD, or *Computer Aided Design* [^2] which broadly describes "technical" (as used in engineering or architecture) designs made with the aid of a computer. CAD designs can be actual drawings or 3D models.

There are hundreds of different definitions of BIM out there, and one usually sees BIM experts arguing endlessly over the correct definition on social networks. I will try my own here:

BIM at its base describes a 3D model of a building, with additional embedded data that permits using that model in many additional ways such as extracting 2D drawings from it like plans and sections, measuring and extracting quantities, such as the number of windows of a certain type or the total area of walls to be built, performing analyses such as estimating how deep the foundations must be, how much the construction will cost or how much heating the building will need at a certain period of time.

BIM is essentially CAD with additional, construction-oriented data. Note that nowadays other engineering areas such as aeronautics still use the term CAD, but they also embed additional data into their models.

By searching on the internet, you will quickly find much broader definitions of BIM, for example some will say BIM does not only describes a file format or 3D model but a process. This often ends up being true. There can be a lot of data in a construction project, the larger the project the more data it contains. When working  on a BIM project in a team, the amount of data you need to share with others often gets large, and the team needs to set up ways to make sure the information is correctly passed from one member to another, and protocols, rules and checks need to be defined. This whole process is usually also referred to as BIM.

There is no central authority that decides about BIM, but there is one, called BuildingSMART [^3], a consortium which gathers several entities involved in the construction industry, that manages a specific file format / protocol used in BIM: the IFC standard, or *Industry Foundation Classes* [^4]. 

The IFC file format is open and readable with a simple text editor, and its specification is public. This, contrarily to closed file formats, allows anybody to legally implement it in their application, and participate to its definition. This makes it a very important foundation of BIM.
