## Introduction

You might be a fervent advocate of BIM, or have your doubts, for example over its usefulness or efficiency. I would put myself in that latter group, probably. One way or another, I think we will all agree BIM has firmly made its stand, and is here to stay. Architecture and engineering practices all over the world have adopted or are adopting it, corporate clients are enforcing it, and administrations are making it a requirement.

BIM presents many interesting and attractive perspectives. Among them are:

* A large part, if not all, of the drawings are automatically generated from a same 3D model. Drafting errors such as one view not showing the same as another view are become a thing of the past.

* Changes in the model are quick and reflected automatically on all generated drawings. Changing the position of a wall becomes just that, changing the position of an element.

* BIM elements have precise volumes and are therefore quantifiable. Depending on the level of detail, a whole and precise quantities schedule can be generated from the model, or even a prices estimation if price data is available.

* Working in 3D unlocks many additional features, such as sun and shadows or terrain movements.

* All kinds of useful outputs can be obtained from a BIM model, outside drawings and schedules, such as energy analyses, structural calculations, construction phasing, image or video renderings or even interactive walk-through.

Together with the good ideas, though, came the bad ideas. Software giants did not take long to see the commercial opportunity behind the perspective of the entire construction sector in need of new software tools.

Today, almost 90% of the commercial BIM authoring tools sold in the world come from only two software companies [^1]. They both provide whole suites of BIM-related tools and go to great extents to maintain users inside their own controlled ecosystem[^2].

When you begin to work with a BIM application, you also begin to model your practice and workflows on the tools and workflows offered by that application. This can lead you to become quickly trapped inside the application's ecosystem further down the road, furthermore when several features, or rather ant-features, have been put in place to make you fall into the trap. Among typical examples are the use of closed, proprietary file formats that can only be opened by one application, or maintaining your files on a company-owned cloud platform. It is interesting to note that these practices do not only happen in the BIM world. They are in fact commonly seen as totally legitimate commercial behaviors.

This is the main reason why me and thousand of other people around the world got interested in and began to contribute to open-source software. We need truly open solutions, that allow us to stay in control of our files and our workflow. It is our work, our most precious value, we should be the one to decide how to do it, where to save it, and we should still be able to open our files whenever we want in 30 years from now, without our current BIM application.

The free and open-source world is large, solid, and produces a lot of powerful, efficient software that is totally fit for professional use. This totally applies to BIM.

The aim of this book is to convince you that the above line is true, and help you getting on board. FreeCAD is my main workhorse, the BIM application I use everyday and I contribute to develop, so FreeCAD is what this book will be about. But I also hope to demonstrate that FreeCAD is part of a much larger world of free and open-source BIM tools, all connectable and all using similar principles of openness, where nobody will be a prisoner anymore, ever.

The [2020 NBS National BIM guide](https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/national-bim-report-2020) indicates a 70% market share for one and 19% for the other.
