*and other open-source tools*

<target: 20 000 words / 120 pages>

### Abstract

This book is a complete presentation of how to create, modify, manage,  import and export [BIM (Building Information Modeling)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) models using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) and other [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) tools. It starts with a broad presentation of what FreeCAD, BIM and open-source are, explains how to set everything up on your computer, and will guide you step by step through how the different components of a BIM models are created, manipulated and modified. It then explains how to enrich your models with non-geometrical information, how to create 2D drawings such as plans and sections from your models, and how to interact with other BIM applications using the industry-standard [IFC file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes).

Finally it will walk you through three models of iconic buildings, which you can download and study.
